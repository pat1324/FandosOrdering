Android practice app

Mock app simulating a food delivery service. 
Communicates with Google Firebase to get location data to display on a map when delivering.
A partner app should exist with this one that is carried by a delivery person to send current location to firebase which this deliveree app can periodically look at to update location.
Currently the coordinates are just manually updated by me!

Not for commercial use.
The name of this app is definitely not a rip-off of a certain international food chain specialising in chicken!

TODO:

Display estimated time to arrival.\
Fix map tracking!!! (an update to android studio has possibly killed it).\
Finish off favorites functionality.
